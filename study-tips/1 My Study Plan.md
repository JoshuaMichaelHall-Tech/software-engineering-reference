#### Bloom's Taxonomy
1. **Remembering:** Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant knowledge from long‐term memory.
2. **Understanding:** Constructing meaning from oral, written, and graphic messages through interpreting, exemplifying, classifying, summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.
3. **Applying:** Carrying out or using a procedure for executing, or implementing.
4. **Analyzing:** Breaking material into constituent parts, determining how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose through differentiating, organizing, and attributing.
5. **Evaluating:** Making judgments based on criteria and standards through checking and critiquing.
6. **Creating:** Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through generating, planning, or producing.

#### Steps For Studying at Launch School
1. First Step
	1. Reads Assignment
	2. Create mind map from memory
	3. Update mind map from assignment
	4. Create list of methods/vocabulary
2. Second Step
	1. Recreate mind map from memory
	2. Using complete mind map, write summaries of all concepts from memory
	3. Using list of methods/vocabulary, write facts/definitions from memory
	4. Write corrections
3. Third Step
	1. Make flash cards from memory
	2. Compares with notes
	3. Second pass through assignment updating/expanding notes/flashcards
	4. Takes quiz at end of each lesson
4. Exam Prep
	1. Create mock exam
	2. Create crib sheet
	3. Practice problems
		1. Solving
		2. Writing explanations
		3. Explaining aloud
	4. Takes mock exam
5. Throughout
	1. Review old mind maps/notes/flash cards
	2. Group Sessions: SPOT, TA, pair
	3. Daily coding challenge
	4. Blogging

#### 3-90 minute intense sessions
1. Learning New Material
2. Practicing
3. Processing

#### Overview
High Impact
- Practice testing
- Distributed practice
Moderate Impact
- Elaborative interrogation
- Self-explanation
- Interleaved practice

#### Details
Practice Testing
- Answering questions, performing tasks, active recall (flashcards, quizzes, study guides, practice problems)
- Active recall is key
- Outperforms nearly every other technique

Distributed Practice
- Short sessions
- Vary topics

Elaborate Interrogation
- Provide explanation of explicitly stated fact
- Appears to help with remembering that fact
- Best for beginners
- Needs more research

Self Explanation
- Explain how to solve task before solving it
- Improves performance on subsequent similar tasks

Interleave Practice
- Reduce 'practice performance'
- Improve 'test performance'
- Relatively few studies


Neuroplasticity
1. Get Alert
	2. 25 deep breaths
	3. Cold showers, exercise, coffee
2. Get focused
	1. Focus on spot on wall for 30 seconds
3. Generate Repetitions
	1. Work faster than comfortable to maximize number of exposures (100 free throws versus 40 per hour)
4. Expect and Embrace Errors
	1. Improve alertness
	2. Some errors is better than no errors
5. Insert Micro Rest Intervals (Random)
	1. During breaks, neurons engage in the same pattern of activity as during learning bout, except 10x faster
6. Use random intermittent rewards
	1. Rewards improve motivation and goal-oriented behavior
7. Limit sessions to 90 minutes
	1. Maximum for maintaining learning
	2. 270 minutes may be close to daily max
8. After Learning Session, do Non-Sleep Deep Rest Session
	1. Brief naps, yoga, self-hypnosis
	2. Within 1 hour of session
9. Get quality and sufficient deep sleep
	1. Learning actually occurs during sleep
	2. Aim to get good sleep 80% of the time
