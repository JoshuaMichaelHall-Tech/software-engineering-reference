Author's Personal Approach
- Target number of blocks per week
- Take 3 passes through material
- First through then take quiz, flunk
- Second through, more detailed, retake quiz
- Go through study guide, write long form
- Read through materials, retake quiz
- Pass through summaries before exam

Are You Assessment Ready

- Have you answered all the practice problems at least once?
	- Point is not just to get an answer, review interesting problems and answer multiple ways
- Have you practiced summarizing the material in your own words?
- Have you gotten 100% on every quiz?
- Can you confidently discuss every topic on the study guide?
- Have you gone through the material a final time and not learned anything new?
- For interviews: have you practiced questions in front of other people?
