# Software Engineering Reference

## Overview
This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for software engineering concepts, best practices, algorithms, design patterns, and career development resources. It supports my mastery-based learning approach by providing structured reference materials across multiple domains of software engineering.

## Purpose
The primary purposes of this repository are:
1. Consolidate learning across multiple programming languages and paradigms
2. Document best practices and design patterns for reference
3. Create a searchable knowledge base for technical concepts
4. Support career development with comprehensive resources
5. Maintain reference materials for interviews and technical discussions
6. Facilitate knowledge transfer between different technology stacks

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, which helped with:
- Documentation writing and organization
- Code structure suggestions
- Troubleshooting and debugging assistance

Claude was used as a development aid while all final implementation decisions and code review were performed by the human developer.
