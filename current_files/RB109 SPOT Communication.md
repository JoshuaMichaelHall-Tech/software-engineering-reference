DO NOT FORGET TO ATTACH THE PDF!!!

Hi Everyone! I look forward to our SPOT session at ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Central Time. So that we can get right to your questions, here is an MD with helpful information for your review. (If you are new to markdown and don't have a way to view this, I recommend using Obsidian: https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/.) 

We will go over the introductions, and I will answer any questions you have about the exam (without giving anything away from the exam). Then we will dive right into working through practice problems! If you have any particular questions, feel free to reply here with them, or just bring them to our session. Thanks and see you soon!

PS We will be meeting in Gather. If you are new to gather, you can get there here: [https://app.gather.town/app/8EeGq1YHbOo08Xso/launchschool](https://app.gather.town/app/8EeGq1YHbOo08Xso/launchschool) Once there, you can find my name on the right, click on it and click on 'follow'. This will lead your character to where I am, a quick way to find the room. If you are new to Gather, you may wish to review the following resources:[https://medium.com/launch-school/introducing-the-launch-school-flatverse-with-gather-town-5241358c2bd4](https://medium.com/launch-school/introducing-the-launch-school-flatverse-with-gather-town-5241358c2bd4)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGR6itnXKDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGR6itnXKDg)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJj0utwkgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJj0utwkgM)
