#### DISCLAIMER
- I am also a fellow student, not a TA
  - I can only speak from my own experience preparing/taking the exams
  - please correct me if I misspeak
- I cannot disclose specific assessment questions

#### WRITTEN EXAM

You will have two hours to answer 10-11 questions. Not all questions are worth the same number of points. Launch School recommends setting 2 timers, one for the two hours, and a second for each question. I recommend skimming the hardest question before you start, but then working the middle point questions first, then the hardest once you are warmed up and confident, and then the easiest once you are getting tired. Make sure to go over all questions a second time to check for formatting and simple errors. I recommend leaving about 20 minutes for this final review.

A common issue is that students fail to give enough specificity in their answers. They may understand what is going on, but can they demonstrate their understanding?

#### INTERVIEW
You will have 30 minutes to answer about 5 questions with a TA. Most people finish within 20. I highly recommend coming to SPOT and TA led sessions, and pairing up for study sessions in Gather where you take turns working through problems in the SPOT wiki: https://fine-ocean-68c.notion.site/SPOT-Wiki-b58ff38ab84440bdb96797e59ee5fd34

#### STUDY GUIDE (For Written and Interview)
For the topics shown below, you should be able to provide clear explanations, using code snippets as examples, and be able to identify these concepts within code snippets.

- Variables
    - Variables as pointers
    - Variable shadowing
    - Local variable scope in relation to method definitions
    - Local variable scope in relation to blocks, including nested blocks and peer blocks
    - Scope of constants
    - Mutating values vs. reassigning variables
- Methods:
    - Method definition vs. method invocation
    - Passing and using blocks with methods
    - Parameters vs. arguments
    - Default parameters
    - Implicit vs. explicit return values
    - Mutating vs. non-mutating methods
    - Using method return values as arguments to other methods
- Mutable vs. immutable data types
- Output vs. return
- Pass-by-reference vs. pass-by-value
- Truthiness

#### Format for Answering Questions
- What does the code output? What are the return values?
- Answer the why behind the output/return:
    - Focus only on the lines of code that deliver the output and return values.
- Summarize what the problem demonstrates and why: 
	- This problem demonstrates the concept of local variable scope/etc.
	- This can be at the beginning or end of your answer - personal preference.

Always aim to answer: What does the following code output and return? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

#### Using Markdown
Use `backticks` before and after code segments (less than one line long) to highlight variable names, methods, and anything in the code to which you refer (but not line numbers). Example: On line 5 variable \`fruit\` is initialized to the value of \`'strawberry'\`. The backtick key is above the tab on most keyboards.

For blocks of code, use three `backticks` with the word 'ruby' (\`\`\`ruby) on the line preceding the block of code, and three more `backticks` (\`\`\`) on the line after the block of code. Markdown-compatible editors (I recommend Obsidian) will display a formatted box for your code which looks like a terminal. Please enter an additional newline before and after the code box for added readability. Example:

(newline)
\`\`\`ruby
(your code here)
\`\`\`
(newline)

#### Personal Recommendation on Taking Tests
Taking these tests requires courage. Most students over-prepare for their first tests because they lack the courage to go ahead and take/schedule the exams. I received a 'Not Yet' the first time I took the RB109 written exam. It was very discouraging, but the problem was not that I didn't know the material, it was that I didn't know how to communicate with the precision and detail required. The second time I took the exam I did very well. I passed the interview in 10 minutes.

Students often ask how they will know when they are ready to take the exam. I recommend the following:
- Work through the curriculum twice
- Take good notes
- Watched all the instructional videos
- Retaken the quizzes until you can get 100%
- Solve every problem in the curriculum (by writing code, not in your head)
- Solve the practice problems in the 'exercise' section of the Launch School portal
- Put together a study guide with code snippets and concept explanations for each topic on the study guide
- Practice with other students in TA or SPOT sessions
- Explain your code in writing and verbally using what you learn from the Speaking Ruby article (https://medium.com/@rebeccabiancofiorecw/speaking-in-ruby-caabc4f1adf6) 
Once you have completed these steps, you should be ready for the exams.

Note: you can use notes for the written exam, but not the interview. So make sure you really know the items on the study guide for the interview! Once you feel that you have all this down, just take the test! The worst thing that can happen is that you receive a 'not yet' on your first exam and then have to retake it a week later. No big deal! It is a learning experience even if you don't pass the first time! Don't let nervousness keep you from taking the text and maintaining your momentum! From what I hear, many of the best Launch School graduates received 2-3 'not yets' early in the program before they fully understood what is expected, so if you receive a couple, do not let it discourage you! Be courageous, don't get discouraged, and once you have worked through your study plan, go for it!
