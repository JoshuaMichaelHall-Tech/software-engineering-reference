**1. Concept and Planning**
•   Define the purpose and goals of your application  
•   Identify your target users and their needs  
•   Create user stories to outline functionality  
•   Determine the scope and minimum viable product (MVP)  
•   Research similar applications and market demand

**2. Requirements Analysis and Design**
•   Translate user stories into technical requirements  
•   Create wireframes and mockups of the interface  
•   Design the database schema and architecture  
•   Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks  
•   Plan the development timeline and milestones

**3. Development Environment Setup**
•   Set up version control (Git/GitHub)  
•   Configure local development environment  
•   Set up testing frameworks  
•   Create project structure and organization

**4. Iterative Development**
•   Build the core features first (MVP approach)  
•   Follow test-driven development where appropriate  
•   Review code regularly for quality and maintainability  
•   Commit changes frequently with descriptive messages

**5. Testing**
•   Write unit tests for individual components  
•   Conduct integration testing for interconnected parts  
•   Perform user acceptance testing  
•   Test for security vulnerabilities  
•   Conduct performance testing

**6. Deployment Preparation**
•   Set up hosting environment  
•   Configure production database  
•   Set up continuous integration/deployment pipelines  
•   Implement monitoring and logging systems

**7. Deployment**
•   Deploy to production environment  
•   Verify functionality in production  
•   Monitor for errors and performance issues

**8. Post-Launch**
•   Gather user feedback  
•   Implement bug fixes and improvements  
•   Plan future features and enhancements  
•   Maintain and update dependencies
